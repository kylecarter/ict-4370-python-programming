/**
 * Assignment 3 | ICT 4370 | Python Programming
 *
 * This represents the code work for addignment two. Note this project
 * was written for Python 3. Requirements:
 *
 * This assignment will provide practice evaluating, selecting, and using
 * dictionaries and loops.
 *
 * Convert the assignment you created in lesson 3 to a solution that uses
 * dictionaries instead of lists. Keep in mind you can nest lists in 
 * dictionaries, dictionaries in lists and lists in lists. Think about the
 * data structure that makes most sense in this problem. Take into account
 * that you may eventually need to keep track of multiple investors.
 *
 * Write a short paragraph explaining which data structure is better to use
 * in this scenario â€“ list(s) or dictionary(ies).
 *
 * As a part of best programming practices include code comments, at the
 * minimum a header with your name, the date the program was written and a
 * short description.

''' Note
I find for both and lists and dictionaries are useful for this application
scenario. In meaning, a list of dictionaries is the best approach here. The
static data provided for this assignment resembles the common query set results
that would come from a database query. Typically query sets are some sort of
list (either a tuple or list; probably a tuple because you don't want the program
altering the original dataset). From there the list will contain a collection of
dictionaries that provide key/value pairs for the individual data points in the
query set.

To break this down further, lists are good for large chuncks of commonly structured
data points. That is they work well with data that is all of the same type. From
there dictionaries work well with data that has similar structure but varying values.
This all said it is best to group the data provided here in a list of dictionaries
and then iterate over the list to process the individual dictionaries that represent
the individual data points.
